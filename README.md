### Hi there 👋

I'm an french engineering student. I'm interested in machine learning and in computer science as a whole.  

I'm since this year a <a href ="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu">Télécom SudParis</a> student.  

I mainly use **Python** to code but I also know **OCaml**, I'm currently learning **Java**, **Bash** and **Rust**. Few years ago I also learnt the basis of **HTML** and **CSS**.

I'm also a private pilot ✈️.  

#### Currents projects/experiments
- I'm curently trying to automate the Super Mario 64 DS mini game _Wanted_ using image recognition. You can check this out and help me <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/AutoWantedMiniGame">here</a> !
Any suggestion is welcome !  🕹
- I'm also trying to make my computer able to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect 4</a>. I'm using few different algorithms, again, any suggestion is welcome. Take a look <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Puissance4">here</a> ! 🧩

#### TIPE
- My TIPE is about prediction algorithms. I used them on the bike sharing system here in Paris : _Vélib'_.  
To know when bikes will be available : check <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/TIPE">here</a>.

#### Previous projects  
- I worked in a team for a school project about robotics and artificial intelligence. The goal is to make an autonomous agricultural robot. Check the <a href='https://github.com/FarmIA/farmia'>organisation</a> to see more of our work ! 🪴
- I made two mass and balance <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Masse-Centrage">calculators</a> for the plane in my aeroclub. It can be use by any pilot in <a href="http://www.aeroclub-cercle-aerien-peugeot.com">_Le Cercle aérien Peugeot_</a>. (_in french only_) ✈️
