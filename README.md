### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an french engineering student.

#### TIPE
- My TIPE is about prediction algorithms. I used them on the bike sharing system here in Paris : _VÃ©lib'_. To know when bikes will be available : check <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/TIPE">here</a>.
It might be updated/upgraded later.

#### Currents projects/experiments
- I'm curently trying to automate the Super Mario 64 DS mini game _Wanted_ using image recognition.  
Any suggestion is welcome !
