### Hi there 👋

I'm an french engineering student.

#### TIPE
- My TIPE is about prediction algorithms. I used them on the bike sharing system here in Paris : _Vélib'_. To know when bikes will be available : check <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/TIPE">here</a>.
It might be updated/upgraded later.

#### Currents projects/experiments
- I'm curently trying to automate the Super Mario 64 DS mini game _Wanted_ using image recognition. You can check this out and help me <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/AutoWantedMiniGame">here</a> !  
Any suggestion is welcome !

#### Previous projects  
- I made two mass and balance <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Masse-Centrage">calculators</a> for the plane in my aeroclub. It can be use by any pilot in _Le Cercle aérien Peugeot_. (_in french only_)
