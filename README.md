### Hi there üëã

I'm an french engineering student. I'm interested in machine learning and in computer science as a whole.  
I'm since this year a <a href ="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu">T√©l√©com SudParis</a> student.
I'm also a private pilot ‚úàÔ∏è.  
I mainly use Python to code but I also know OCaml as I'm learning it for the two past years. Few years ago I also learnt the basis of HTML and CSS. I plan to learn few more langages such as Java, Swift, and maybe C.

#### TIPE
- My TIPE is about prediction algorithms. I used them on the bike sharing system here in Paris : _V√©lib'_.  
To know when bikes will be available : check <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/TIPE">here</a>.
It might be updated/upgraded later.

#### Currents projects/experiments
- I'm curently trying to automate the Super Mario 64 DS mini game _Wanted_ using image recognition. You can check this out and help me <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/AutoWantedMiniGame">here</a> !  
Any suggestion is welcome !
- I'm also trying to make my computer able to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect 4</a>. I'm using few different algorithms, again, any suggestion is welcome. Take a look <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Puissance4">here</a> !

#### Previous projects  
- I made two mass and balance <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Masse-Centrage">calculators</a> for the plane in my aeroclub. It can be use by any pilot in <a href="http://www.aeroclub-cercle-aerien-peugeot.com">_Le Cercle a√©rien Peugeot_</a>. (_in french only_)
