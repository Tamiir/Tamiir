### Hi there 👋

I'm an french engineering student. I'm interested in cybersecurity and in computer science as a whole.  

I'm a <a href ="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu">Télécom SudParis</a> student.
	
I'm quite decent with **Python**, **Bash**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Typescript** (React Native), **OCaml**, **Java**, and I'm still learning **C** and **Rust**.

I'm also a (retired) private pilot ✈️.  

#### Currents projects/experiments
- I begin to do a website that uses the Strava API to track users' walk and run activities and make a little game out of it. The idea is to make users discover a map full of fog-of-war that will be revealed as they walk/run. They can also collect Peaks (mountain summits) and places. It uses React Native for the frontend and Python for the backend. <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Peak">Peak</a>
- I'm making a website for my TIPE (see below). I'm doing the frontend and the API to work with the backend i did several years ago. The goal is to make this project available for anyone. 🚲
- Ive made a network scanner script in shell script that uses nmap and other tools to gather information about hosts of the network you're in. It creates a report at the end of the scan. <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/scan_net">scan_net</a>

#### Previous projects  
- I tried to automate the Super Mario 64 DS mini game _Wanted_ using image recognition. This project is a bit left behind. You can check this out and help me <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/AutoWantedMiniGame">here</a> !
Any suggestion is welcome !  🕹
- My TIPE is about prediction algorithms. I used them on the bike sharing system here in Paris : _Vélib'_.  
To know when bikes will be available : check <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/TIPE">here</a>.
- I worked in a team for a school project about robotics and artificial intelligence. The goal was to make an autonomous agricultural robot. Check the <a href='https://github.com/FarmIA/farmia'>organisation</a> to see more of our work ! 🪴
- I made two mass and balance <a href="https://github.com/Tamiir/Masse-Centrage">calculators</a> for the plane in my aeroclub. It can be use by any pilot in <a href="http://www.aeroclub-cercle-aerien-peugeot.com">_Le Cercle aérien Peugeot_</a>. (_in french only_) ✈️
